LazyRenamer is a tool for renaming or copying a group of associated files.
For example, if you have a bundle of files called:
   Land.shp
   Land.dbf
   Land.shx
   Land.prj
   Land.mwsr
   Land.lbl,
To rename all the files at once simply drag one of them onto the program, type the new name, and press [enter].
To copy all the files instead, press [tab] and then [enter].

LazyRenamer also updates the Layer Name attribute in MapWindow MWSR files.

Lazyrenamer can handle files with multiple extensions - useful when you have sets of files that keep growing like this:
   Sails.stc.dwh.01.bak
   Sails.stc.mdb
   Sails.stc.mdb.01.bak
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_1.out
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_1.out.01.bak
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_165.out
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_165.out.01.bak
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_204.out
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_204.out.01.bak
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_214.out
   Sails.stc.mdb_1_216.out
   Sails.stc
   Sails.stc.01.bak
   Sails.stc.dwh

Microsoft .NET Framework 2.0 or later is required to run this program.
