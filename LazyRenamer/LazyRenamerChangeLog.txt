LazyRenamer v1.2 highlights

- Support for real operating systems (e.g. Linux) via Mono
- save .ini file in the user's application data folder, instead of the working directory
- accept a file as an input argument at startup (drag-and-drop onto LazyRenamer.exe)
- only rename files with _case sensitively_ matching basenames, to prevent errors trying to rename two _case insensitively_ matching files to the same name
- improvements to validation of entered filenames
- rename matching folders as well as files
- performance improvements for really slow environments
- other minor improvements
