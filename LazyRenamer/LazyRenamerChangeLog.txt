LazyRenamer v1.1 highlights

- Fix bug where error "files appears to be in use by another program" is produced if the path of the containing directory includes a .
- Also rename matching files with no extension
- Don't allow naming with the same name as an existing directory (could cause an error)
- Add "copy" button
- Show four lines of file path (three is not enough)
- Allow multiple instances
