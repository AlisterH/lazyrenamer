LazyRenamer v1.3 highlights

- Validate new name when using cut, paste or undo via the right-click menu
- Improvements to gui behaviour when there is an error renaming
- Don't use temporary files (except for .mwsr): avoids bogus error when there is another file with #tmp suffix in the directory, and fixes .mwsr processing, which was broken.

----------------
LazyRenamer v1.2 highlights

- Support for real operating systems (e.g. Linux) via Mono
- Save .ini file in the user's application data folder, instead of the working directory
- Accept a file as an input argument at startup (drag-and-drop onto LazyRenamer.exe)
- Only rename files with _case sensitively_ matching basenames, to prevent errors trying to rename two _case insensitively_ matching files to the same name
- Improvements to validation of entered filenames
- Rename matching folders as well as files
- Performance improvements for really slow environments
- Other minor improvements


----------------
LazyRenamer v1.1 highlights

- Fix bug where error "files appears to be in use by another program" is produced if the path of the containing directory includes a .
- Also rename matching files with no extension
- Don't allow naming with the same name as an existing directory (could cause an error)
